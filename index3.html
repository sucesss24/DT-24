    <h1>Situational Awareness</h1>
    <img src="n2.jpg" alt="Self-Defense ">
    <p>Situational awareness is the ability to recognize and understand your surroundings, identify potential threats, and make informed decisions to stay safe. This skill can help you prevent dangerous situations before they escalate.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Points to Enhance Situational Awareness</h2>
        <p>Developing situational awareness involves several key practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pay Attention to People Around You:</strong> Observe the behavior of people nearby. Look for signs of unusual or suspicious activity. Trust your instincts if something feels off.</li>
            <li><strong>Identify Exits and Escape Routes:</strong> Always be aware of the exits and potential escape routes in any environment you are in. This helps you plan a quick exit if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Aware of Unusual Behavior or Situations:</strong> Notice changes in your environment or the behavior of people around you. For instance, someone loitering or acting strangely could be a potential threat.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Real-Life Examples</h2>
        <p>Understanding situational awareness through real-life examples can help reinforce its importance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> A person walking through a parking lot notices a vehicle that has been parked in the same spot for a prolonged period with someone inside. The individual decides to walk closer to a well-lit area and remains alert.</li>
            <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> While shopping, someone notices a group of people behaving aggressively in one section of the store. The person avoids that area and chooses a safer path to exit the store.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Practical Tips for Improving Situational Awareness</h2>
        <p>Enhance your situational awareness with these practical tips:</p>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><strong>Stay Off Your Phone:</strong> Avoid distractions such as using your phone while walking or traveling. It’s important to stay alert and aware of your surroundings.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Scanning:</strong> Regularly scan your environment. Make it a habit to glance around and assess the people and objects in your vicinity.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the 360-Degree Awareness Technique:</strong> Imagine a 360-degree circle around you and mentally check each section for potential threats or changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If something doesn’t feel right, take action to protect yourself. Your instincts can often alert you to potential danger before it becomes apparent.</li>
