    <h1>Physical Self-Defense Techniques</h1>
    <img src="3.jpeg" alt="Self-Defense Intro">
    <p>Learning physical self-defense techniques is crucial for protecting yourself in dangerous situations. These techniques focus on how to effectively respond to physical threats using strikes, blocks, and escapes.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Essential Techniques</h2>
        <p>Here are some fundamental self-defense techniques:</p>
        <ul class="techniques-list">
            <li><strong>Punches:</strong> Target vulnerable areas such as the nose, jaw, or solar plexus. Practice various punches, including straight punches, hooks, and uppercuts.</li>
            <li><strong>Kicks:</strong> Use kicks to create distance or incapacitate an attacker. Focus on kicks like front kicks, side kicks, and roundhouse kicks. Aim for sensitive areas such as the groin or knees.</li>
            <li><strong>Blocks:</strong> Learn how to block incoming attacks effectively. Practice high blocks, low blocks, and inside blocks to protect yourself from strikes.</li>
            <li><strong>Escapes:</strong> Techniques for freeing yourself from holds or grabs. Practice escapes from wrist grabs, bear hugs, and chokes. Learn to use leverage and body movement to break free.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Defensive Stances and Movements</h2>
        <p>Maintaining a good stance and using proper movements can enhance your ability to defend yourself:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Stance:</strong> Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hands up to protect your head and torso.</li>
            <li><strong>Side Stance:</strong> Shift your weight to one foot and angle your body sideways to minimize exposure and improve mobility.</li>
            <li><strong>Footwork:</strong> Practice moving quickly and efficiently. Use techniques like stepping off-line, pivoting, and maintaining balance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Advice for Practice</h2>
        <p>Consistent practice is key to mastering self-defense techniques. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Practice regularly to build muscle memory and confidence. Include both solo drills and partner exercises.</li>
            <li>Seek instruction from a qualified self-defense or martial arts instructor to ensure proper technique and safety.</li>
