    <p>Staying safe in public areas is crucial. This module will cover strategies to help you protect yourself in various public settings, including parks, streets, and public transport.</p>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Points:</h2>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><strong>Stay in Well-Lit Areas:</strong> When walking at night, choose routes that are well-lit and populated to reduce the risk of encountering dangerous situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Distractions:</strong> Keep your attention focused on your surroundings. Avoid using headphones or being engrossed in your phone while walking.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Your Valuables:</strong> Keep your phone, wallet, and other valuables out of sight, especially in crowded areas where pickpocketing is more common.</li>

        <h2>Practical Safety Tips:</h2>
        <ul class="tips-list">
            <li><strong>Be Aware of Your Surroundings:</strong> Regularly scan your environment and the people around you. Trust your instincts if something feels off.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan Your Route:</strong> Before heading out, plan your route and be aware of your surroundings. Inform someone you trust of your plans when going to unfamiliar places.</li>
            <li><strong>Walk with Confidence:</strong> Maintain a confident posture and walk with purpose. This can deter potential threats as it signals that you are aware and in control.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Public Transport Wisely:</strong> If using public transport, sit in well-populated areas and be cautious of overly familiar strangers. Keep your belongings secure and stay alert.</li>
            <li><strong>Have an Emergency Plan:</strong> Know where the nearest safe places, like police stations or public buildings, are located. Have a plan in place for how to seek help if needed.</li>

            <li><strong>Know How to Call for Help:</strong> Familiarize yourself with emergency contact numbers and how to use them. Practice speaking clearly and providing essential information when calling for help.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Self-Defense Tools:</strong> If you carry self-defense tools such as pepper spray, ensure you know how to use them properly. Follow local regulations regarding their use and carry them securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Seek Assistance:</strong> If you feel threatened, donâ€™t hesitate to approach a trusted individual or seek help from nearby security personnel. Public spaces often have staff or security to assist in emergencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice De-escalation:</strong> If confronted, try to de-escalate the situation using calm and non-threatening communication. Avoid aggressive responses and focus on diffusing tension.</li>
