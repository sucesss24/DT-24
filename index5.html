    <p>While no one is ever to blame for being targeted for violence, it's essential for women to know how to protect themselves. Here are some powerful self-defense techniques to help you stay safe:</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Techniques:</h2>
        <ul class="techniques-list">
            <li><strong>Know the Human Body:</strong> Familiarize yourself with the weak points of the human body. These include the eyes, nose, and throat. Other weak points include the solar plexus, groin, and knees.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn Basic Moves:</strong> Use palm heel strikes, eye strikes, knee strikes, and elbow jabs to disable attackers. Practice these moves to ensure you can execute them effectively in a high-stress situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Drop Low:</strong> If grabbed from behind, drop your center of gravity to throw the attacker off balance. This can create an opportunity for you to break free.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Your Head:</strong> Use your forehead or throw your head back into the attacker to create distance. This technique can help you escape a grab or hold.</li>
            <li><strong>Arm Yourself:</strong> Carry pepper spray, a whistle, or other self-defense tools. Be aware of the legal restrictions on some weapons in your area and ensure you know how to use them effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Additional Techniques:</h2>
        <ul class="techniques-list">
            <li><strong>Use Your Elbows and Knees:</strong> These parts of the body can deliver powerful strikes when used correctly. Aim for the attacker's vulnerable areas to maximize impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Self-Defense Moves:</strong> Regular practice of self-defense techniques is crucial. Consider joining a self-defense class or workshop to refine your skills and boost your confidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Utilize Everyday Items:</strong> Items such as keys, pens, or a handbag can be used as improvised weapons. Be creative and use whatever you have on hand to protect yourself.</li>
            <li><strong>Employ Defensive Stances:</strong> Learn and practice defensive stances that can help you maintain balance and prepare for potential attacks. These stances can also help you move quickly and effectively.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Safety Tips:</h2>
        <p>In addition to learning self-defense techniques, it's important to adopt general safety practices to reduce the risk of encountering dangerous situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Aware of Your Surroundings:</strong> Stay alert and pay attention to your environment. Avoid distractions and remain vigilant in unfamiliar or potentially risky situations.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If you feel uncomfortable or sense that something is wrong, take action to protect yourself. Your instincts can often guide you to safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Develop a Safety Plan:</strong> Create a plan for various scenarios, such as what to do if someone follows you or how to get help in an emergency. Share this plan with friends or family members.</li>
        </ul>
